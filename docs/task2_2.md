# Task 2.2
## Results
- We can see nice "bell-curve" on chart for PV forecast, "obviously" following the day/night cycle. The DayAhead forecast is lower (especialy in peak time arround 12:00) the Intraday forecast
- Wind forecast is more stable with slight dropdown arround 10:00 The wind forecast has lower intraday forecasts the DayAhead forecasts

## Asumptions
- The bell-curve on chart for PV forecast can help predict mostu usually available volume from PV production as well, and point, to times arround 12:00 to buy on DayAhead contract and sell on intraday contract, while windforecast is in theory showing opportunity to buy on intraday and sold on DayAhaed contract if my assumption is correct. Wouldrequire backtest to confirm this assumption.
