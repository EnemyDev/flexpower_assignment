# Task 2.1
## process
- I did get final values by multiplying by 0.25 (making one quarter) out of forecasts on MW in order to translate to MWH
- Final result is sum of all MWH values
## results
- Wind DA MWh for 2021    115395406.25
- Wind ID MWh for 2021    113478034.5
- PV DA MWh for 2021      46094572.75
- PV ID MWh for 2021      46689891.5
## Assumptions
- The higher forecasted production may decrease the energy price in given hours.
