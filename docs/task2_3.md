# Task 2.3
## Results
- Average value for Wind Power in 2021: 81.39 EUR/MWh
- Average value for PV Power in 2021: 76.89 EUR/MWh
- Average Day Ahead Price in 2021: 96.85 EUR/MWh
## Assumptions
- The average value of Wind Power is lower than the average DA price.
  - This could happen if wind production often occurs during low demand or high supply times. In previous task, we seen wind beeing stable, with little drop when the PV starts peaking what confirms this assumption.
- The average value of PV Power is lower than the average DA price.
  - This might occur because PV production might not always match peak demand times. We know the forecast peak is always arround 12:00 while the peak in prices (based on task with battery) are outside of theese times.
